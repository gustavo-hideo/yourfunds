Stockhoder's equity
When you buy a business, this is how much equity you get as a shareholder
The number the balances out the balance sheet
(total assets - total liabilities)
If stockholder's equity is going down over the years, it means that the liabilities are growing faster than the assets

	Retained earnings
	Amount of net income the business generated after paying out all of its dividends


How to determine if the company is stable:
total current assets / total current liabilities
Good to be above one (depending on the business, it's normal to be below 1 because they normally carry lots of debts, like airlines)
A ratio above 2 is very good.
A ratio above 3 will never go out of business
The highest the ratio, the safer and less risky the company is.
It will tell you how much debt the business has, compared to its assets

See overtime if the total current assets, total cash, ratio, etc, are increasing or decreasing.

View of total current assets vs total current liabilities will tell you how the company is doing
